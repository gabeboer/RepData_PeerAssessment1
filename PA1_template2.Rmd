Header settings saying that code always needs to be shown.
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#setwd("~/Coursera R folder")
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
###1. Reading the data file
This is an R Markdown document for the Reproducible Research assignment. 
The first step is to manually manipulate the csv file in notepad. Removing all quotes ("").
Didn't find a proper way in R to do it.
The second step is reading the data from csv file. 

```{r csv reading}
act <- read.csv("activity.csv", sep = ",", header = FALSE, skip = 1, quote = "")

names(act)[1] <- "Steps"
names(act)[2] <- "Date"
names(act)[3] <- "Interval"

```

###2. Process/Transform the data (if necessary) into a format more suitable for your analysis
The date format is a bit awkward and needs some adjustments. Currently in "yyyy-mm-dd". With lubridate
package some adjustments and additional values can be made (weekday) and make interval hours-minutes

``` {r date}
#act$Steps <- as.numeric(act$Steps)
act$Date <- as.Date(act$Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

```
A quick summary of the loaded data will give:
``` {r summary, echo=FALSE}
summary(act)

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day
### 1. Number of steps calculation
``` {r total steps}

totalsteps <- aggregate(Steps~Date, act, FUN = sum, na.action = na.omit)
#head(totalsteps, 10)
summary(totalsteps)
```
### 2. plot in histogram
``` {r plot}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(totalsteps$Steps,geom="histogram", 
      binwidth = 1000, 
      xlab = "Total steps per day", 
      ylab = "Frequency",
      main = "histogram steps per day")

```

### 3a. the mean of the total number of steps taken per day
``` {r mean}
mean(totalsteps$Steps)
```
### 3b. the median of the total number of steps taken per day
``` {r median}
median(totalsteps$Steps)
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?
### 1. Make a time series plot of the 5-min interval (x) and the avg number of steps (y)
``` {r 5min_interval}
min5 <- aggregate(Steps~Interval, data = act, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)

ggplot(
        data = min5,
        aes(
                x = Interval,
                y = Steps)) +
        geom_line() +
        xlab("5 minutes interval") +
        ylab("Average number of steps per day") +
        ggtitle("Average Daily Activity Pattern")


```

### 2. which 5 min interval contains max number of steps? 
``` {r maximal steps}
max <- min5$Interval[which.max(min5$Steps)]
max
```


## Imputing missing values
The number of rows with NA values was allready available from the summary on the data set.
### 1. calculate and report the total number of missing values
``` {r NA rows}
summary(act)

```
Showing that in 'dimension Steps' there are 2.304 rows with value NA.

### 2. Devise strategy for filling the missing values in data set
The 2.304 lines will get the average value of the interval (across days).
### 3. create new dataset including values for missing values (6)
``` {r imputed values}
# make copy of original df
act2 <- act

# NA records wegschrijven
act2na <- is.na(act2$Steps)

# determine average of interval without na records
intavg <- tapply(act2$Steps, act2$Interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE, simplify = TRUE)

# add values of average to the na records
act2$Steps[act2na] <- intavg[as.character(act2$Interval[act2na])]
head(act2, 10)

```
### 4. Make histogram (7)
``` {r plot_imputed}
totstepsim <- aggregate(Steps~Date, act2, FUN = sum)
qplot(totstepsim$Steps, geom = "histogram", 
      binwidth = 1000, 
      
      xlab = "Total steps per day", 
      ylab = "Frequency",
      main = "histogram steps per day (imputed values for NA)"
     )

```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

### 1. Create a new factor variable in dataset 
``` {r weekdays}
# df with imputed values is starting point, make copy
act3 <- act2

# create weekdays column using function weekdays()
act3$wkd <- weekdays(act3$Date)

# create column where is stated weekday or weekend using ifelse(test, yes, no)
act3$work <- ifelse(act3$wkd == "zaterdag" | act3$wkd == "zondag", "weekend", "weekday")

```

### 2. Make a panel plot containing time series plot (8)
``` {r last_plot}
min52 <- aggregate(Steps~Interval + work, data = act3, FUN = mean)

ggplot(
        data = min52,
        aes(    x = Interval,
                y = Steps,
                color = work)) +
        #facet_grid(work~.) +
        facet_wrap(~work, ncol =1, nrow = 2) +
        geom_line() + 
        labs(title="Average number of daily steps", 
             x="Intervals",
        y="Number of steps")
        
        

```
